k-means clustering 

The python file uses one of the 4 datasets stored in each of the text files. The output shows how the kmeans algorithm works, how points are moved from one cluster to another. The program can handle datasets with 2 or more fields.

You can add your own datasets. All the values should be integers or decimal numbers. 
The first field should always be row number i.e. 1,2,3,4,5....


sample output:
....
....
0 -> 161 -> 2   43      157     181
1 -> 96 -> 2    43      156     182
....
....

meaning:
point 161 is moved from cluster0 to cluster2, cluster0 = 43 points ,cluster1 = 157 points, cluster2 = 181 points
point 96  is moved from cluster1 to cluster2, cluster0 = 43 points ,cluster1 = 156 points, cluster2 = 182 points
