k-means clustering 

The python file uses one of the 4 datasets stored in each of the text files. The output shows how the kmeans algorithm works, how points are moved from one cluster to another. The program can handle datasets with 2 or more fields.

You can add your own datasets. All the values should be integers or decimal numbers. 
The first field should always be row number i.e. 1,2,3,4,5....
